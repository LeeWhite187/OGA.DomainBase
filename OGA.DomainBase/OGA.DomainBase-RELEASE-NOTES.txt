Type:			Project Release Notes
For:			Domain Base Library
Date:			20220927
Description:	This is the base set of standardized classes for domain design usage.
				It includes the following:
					Aggregate root interface, to be inherited by all aggregate types.
					Base repository interface, to be inherited by all repository classes.
					Base configuration element entity class for standardized configuration storage.
					Base domain object, to be inherited by all domain classes.
					Base value object, to be inherited by all value objects, and classes with sample usage.
					Base user context class, to allow for the implementation of role-based security at the domain service layer.
					Query helpers to produce sorted and filtered paginated query results, at the domain service layer, with predicate building.
Project Organizational Notes:
				This library supports multiple Net Core targets (5 and 6) from a single Shared Project.
				And, it also include testing in both targets from a single Shared project (of testing code).
				Here's a list of the projects, to clarify each one's purpose:
					OGA_DomainBase				Net 5 Target project
					OGA_DomainBase_NET6			Net 6 Target project
					OGA_DomainBase_SP			Shared code for target projects
					OGA_DomainBase_NET6_Tests	Net 6 Target tests
					OGA_DomainBase_Test2		Net 5 Target tests
					OGA_DomainBase_Tests_SP		Shared code of test projects
Targets:		Two compiled targets are currently generated. Both support all entity ID datatypes (string, int, Guid, etc), using a generic.
Dependencies:	.NET 5.0
				.NET 6.0
				OGA.SharedKernel v1.2.1

----------------------------------------
History:
	Release:	v2.0.4
	Date:		20220625
	Build:		16
	Changes:
		1.	Added Net 6 support and reorganized library tests.

	Release:	v2.0.3
	Date:		20220625
	Build:		15
	Changes:
		1.	Added Net 6 support and reorganized library tests.

	Release:	v2.0.2
	Date:		20220423
	Build:		14
	Changes:
		1.	Updated the Domain Base project with latest dependencies.

	Release:	v2.0.0
	Date:		20220213
	Build:		12
	Changes:
		1.	Updated the Domain Base project to utilize a generic type for the entity ID across all classes.
			This change allows for one compiled binary to be used for all Id types.

	Release:	v1.1.2
	Date:		20220204
	Build:		10
	Changes:
		1.	Updated the Paginated List interface to contain a List of TResult, instead of inherit from a List of TResult.
			This change allows the pagination properties to show up in the query result.

	Release:	v1.1.1
	Date:		20220203
	Build:		9
	Changes:
		1.	Updated the Predicate Builder class file to revise the sample usage of it.
			No functional change made for this, just updating comments of sample usage.
		2.	Added two new PaginatedList interfaces, called, IMappingPaginatedList and IMappingPaginatedList_withURL.
			These interfaces are similar to the generic PaginatedList interface, with the following changes:
				The generic variable is renamed to TResult, instead of T.
				And, the interface name is different because these interfaces are intended to be used when a source object type
				is mapped into a target object type during pagination.
			These two interfaces are used in places such as a Web API controller endpoint, where a domain service returns
				an IQueryable of some domain entity type, and the API needs to transform that into a paginated results list
				of a DTO object type.
			The implementations of these new mapping paginated list interfaces interfaces will likely use an AutoMapper library
				or some bespoke mapping logic. Either of which, will be referenced in the Web API layer.
			This source to result mapping functionality will let the mapping paginated list classes do the dirty work of mapping
				entities to DTOs, while forming the paginated listing that will be returned to the caller.
