	Release:	v2.0.0
	Date:		20220213
	Build:		12
	Changes:
		1.	Updated the Domain Base project to utilize a generic type for the entity ID across all classes.

	Date:		20220204
	Build:		10
	Changes:
		1.	Updated the Paginated List interface to contain a List of TResult, instead of inherit from a List of TResult.
			This change allows the pagination properties to show up in the query result.

	Release:	v1.1.1
	Date:		20220203
	Build:		9
	Changes:
		1.	Updated the Predicate Builder class file to revise the sample usage of it.
			No functional change made for this, just updating comments of sample usage.
		2.	Added two new PaginatedList interfaces, called, IMappingPaginatedList and IMappingPaginatedList_withURL.
			These interfaces are similar to the generic PaginatedList interface, with the following changes:
				The generic variable is renamed to TResult, instead of T.
				And, the interface name is different because these interfaces are intended to be used when a source object type
				is mapped into a target object type during pagination.
			These two interfaces are used in places such as a Web API controller endpoint, where a domain service returns
				an IQueryable of some domain entity type, and the API needs to transform that into a paginated results list
				of a DTO object type.
			The implementations of these new mapping paginated list interfaces interfaces will likely use an AutoMapper library
				or some bespoke mapping logic. Either of which, will be referenced in the Web API layer.
			This source to result mapping functionality will let the mapping paginated list classes do the dirty work of mapping
				entities to DTOs, while forming the paginated listing that will be returned to the caller.
